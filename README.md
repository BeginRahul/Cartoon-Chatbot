# Cartoon Talks Chatbot

This is a simple rule-based chatbot that answers questions about cartoon characters. It works by matching user input with predefined rules and returning appropriate responses.

## How to Run the Chatbot

### Terminal Version
1. Install Python (if you donâ€™t have it installed).
2. Run the `chatbot.py` script in your terminal by navigating to the directory and typing `python chatbot.py`.
3. Type your questions and the bot will respond. Type "exit" to quit.

### GUI Version (Optional)
1. Run the `chatbot_gui.py` script in your terminal by typing `python chatbot_gui.py`.
2. A graphical interface will open where you can type questions and get responses.

## Dependencies
- None for the terminal version.
- For the GUI version, `tkinter` comes pre-installed with Python.

## Code Explanation
- **chatbot.py**: Contains the main logic for the chatbot, using `if-else` statements or dictionary lookups to provide answers.
- **chatbot_gui.py**: Adds a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library.

## Possible Future Developments
- Add more cartoon characters and responses.
- Enhance the chatbot by adding more complex rules, like answering questions related to the traits or storylines of characters.
- Add voice input/output for a more interactive experience.
